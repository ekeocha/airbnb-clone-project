## Database Design
This section outlines the core entities and relationships that form the foundation of the Airbnb clone's database schema.

### üìå Key Entities & Fields
1. Users
Represents individuals who can list properties, make bookings, and leave reviews.
- id (Primary Key): Unique identifier for each user
- name: Full name of the user
- email: Email address (must be unique)
- password_hash: Encrypted password
- role: Either "host" or "guest"
2. Properties
Represents listings created by hosts.
- id (Primary Key): Unique identifier for each property
- user_id (Foreign Key): References the host who owns the property
- title: Name or headline of the listing
- description: Detailed information about the property
- location: Address or city of the property
- price_per_night: Cost to book per night
3. Bookings
Represents reservations made by guests.
- id (Primary Key): Unique identifier for each booking
- user_id (Foreign Key): References the guest who made the booking
- property_id (Foreign Key): References the booked property
- start_date: Check-in date
- end_date: Check-out date
- status: Booking status (e.g., confirmed, cancelled)
4. Reviews
Represents feedback left by guests after a stay.
- id (Primary Key): Unique identifier for each review
- user_id (Foreign Key): References the guest who wrote the review
- property_id (Foreign Key): References the reviewed property
- rating: Numeric score (e.g., 1‚Äì5)
- comment: Textual feedback
5. Payments
Represents transactions for bookings.
- id (Primary Key): Unique identifier for each payment
- booking_id (Foreign Key): References the associated booking
- amount: Total amount paid
- payment_method: e.g., credit card, PayPal
- payment_status: e.g., paid, pending, failed

### üîó Entity Relationships
- A User can be a Host (owns multiple Properties) or a Guest (makes Bookings and leaves Reviews).
- A Property belongs to one User (host) but can have many Bookings and Reviews.
- A Booking is made by a User (guest) for one Property and has one Payment.
- A Review is written by a User (guest) for one Property.
- A Payment is linked to one Booking.



## Feature Breakdown
This section outlines the core features of the Airbnb Clone project, each designed to replicate essential functionality of the real platform and provide a seamless user experience.

### üë§ User Management
Handles user registration, authentication, and profile management. It ensures secure access and allows users to act as either guests or hosts depending on their role.
### üè† Property Management
Allows hosts to create, update, and delete property listings. Each listing includes details like location, price, description, and images, enabling guests to browse and choose accommodations.
### üìÖ Booking System
Enables guests to book available properties for specific dates. It includes availability checks, booking status updates, and prevents double-booking through date conflict validation.
### üí¨ Review System
Lets guests leave feedback and ratings after their stay. Reviews help build trust and transparency, influencing future booking decisions for other users.
### üí≥ Payment Integration
Processes payments securely for confirmed bookings. It supports multiple payment methods and tracks transaction status to ensure smooth financial operations.

## üîê API Security
Securing the backend APIs is essential to protect sensitive user data, ensure system integrity, and maintain trust across the platform. Below are the key security measures that will be implemented:
### üîë Authentication
Authentication verifies the identity of users accessing the system. By implementing secure login mechanisms (e.g., JWT tokens or OAuth), we ensure that only legitimate users can interact with protected endpoints. This is critical for safeguarding personal information and preventing unauthorized access.
### üõÇ Authorization
Authorization determines what actions a user is allowed to perform. Role-based access control (RBAC) will be used to restrict access based on user roles (e.g., host vs guest), ensuring users can only perform actions appropriate to their permissions‚Äîlike editing their own listings or viewing their own bookings.
### üö¶ Rate Limiting
Rate limiting helps prevent abuse and denial-of-service attacks by restricting the number of requests a user or IP can make within a given timeframe. This protects the system from overload and ensures fair usage across all users.
### üßä Data Encryption
Sensitive data such as passwords and payment details will be encrypted both in transit (using HTTPS) and at rest. This prevents data leaks and protects user privacy, especially during financial transactions.
### üß™ Input Validation & Sanitization
All incoming data will be validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, XSS). This ensures that malicious inputs cannot compromise the database or frontend.


## CI/CD Pipeline
CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) pipelines automate the process of building, testing, and deploying code. This ensures that new changes are integrated smoothly and delivered quickly without manual intervention. For a project like an Airbnb clone, CI/CD helps maintain code quality, reduce bugs, and accelerate feature delivery.

#### Key tools that can be used include:
- **GitHub** Actions: Automates workflows for testing, building, and deploying code directly from your GitHub repository.
- **Docker**: Containerizes the application to ensure consistent environments across development, testing, and production.
- **Jenkins**: A powerful automation server that can manage complex build and deployment pipelines.
- **Heroku or Vercel**: For seamless deployment of frontend and backend services.
By integrating these tools, the development process becomes more reliable, scalable, and efficient‚Äîespecially as the project grows.
